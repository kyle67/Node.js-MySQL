# Node.js-MySQL

## In this activity I  created an Amazon-like storefront with the MySQL skills learned in the current unit. The app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory. To ensrue that data input and storage took place the MySQL and Inquirer npm packages were saved and required for this app.
